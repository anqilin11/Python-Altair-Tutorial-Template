# Python-Altair-Tutorial-Template

This is a Community Contribution work for STATW5702 EDAV

Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python. It offers a powerful and concise visualization grammar that enables users to build a wide range of statistical visualizations quickly and simply.

Therefore, here I created a tutorial template for common use of Altair for data visualization. The file is in .ipynb format.
